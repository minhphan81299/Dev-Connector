Learning:
1) mongoose.connect will return a Promise
2) Normally every basic API resource contains of two parts:
-   a controller which handles the different request types(POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
-   the actual resource that takes care of the CRUD operations
3) Why use body-parser :  
-   http sends your form data in bits and pieces which are intended to get assembled as they reach their destination. So how would you extract your data.
-   body-parser parses your request and converts it into a format from which you can easily extract relevant information that you may need.
So basically, body-parser parsed your incoming request, assembled the chunks containing your form data, then created this body object for you and filled it with your form data.
4) app.post and get return Promise
-   example: app.post().then(data=>res.json(data))
5) JSON WEB TOKEN
-   Authentication: When user logged in and then make requests which contain JWT. This will allow user access in urls, service and resource. 
=> This method is not affected by Cross-origin-Resource Sharing(Cors) because it does not use Cookie
- What is Cors ? Cors is the method that allow another domain being able to query  (fonts, Javascript, v.vâ€¦) of website

6) DB FindOne() and find() method will return Promise
Packages
1) config : create a global variable used for the whole app ( create default.json and add variable into it, when use require('config') it will use the variable which you declare in default.json)
(to use it: 
- create a variable mongoURI in file default.json in config folder
- const db = config.get("mongoURI");
